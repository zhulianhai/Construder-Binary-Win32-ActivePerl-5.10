updated to latest Construder state:

- gameplay: added jumper items, which can teleport the player
  once into a certain direction.
- code: remove some debugging output from server UI stuff.
- ui: display the name of the object in the selected slot.
- engine: rewrote (de)materialization to be more generic, tick
  driven and handle player logouts more gracefully.
- renderer: try to cleanup unused ctr_dyn_bufs more eagerly.
  the client now eats ram much much slower.
- code: small init memleak fix. which did not occur yet.
- engine: cleanup more data structures that were filled
  needlessly.
- engine: plugged a small memory leak that had the potential to
  grow really big.
- game: english corrections, thanks a lot Zaba!
- engine: cleaning up the axis arrays, even though they are
  really not _that_ expensive memory wise.
- engine: use static buffer for chunk data serialization.
- engine: added memory profiling counters.
- code: moved debugging code into Construder.pm again.
  Hopefully the CPAN indexer doesn't find it this time...
* made it much easier to browse materials in the material view.
* tuned down initial jump upward velocity, to make hovering easier.

updated to latest Construder state:

* lots of bug fixes!
* world: expanded the world a bit to be infinite again. The sphere hull is sitting in the center of a giant void box now, which is 400x400x400 sectors big.
* gameplay: the player is not teleported to void sectors anymore when he is randomly teleported.
* world: rethought light distribution a bit. The world is now a bit brighter in general due to many more placed lights. I hope the iterative server light calculation does not overwhelm anyone's computer.
* Redesign of the world. The World is now a gigantic sphere hull which is 100 sectors thick. There is a center at sector 0,0,0 from which X, Y and Z axises are expanding 131 sectors in each direction. The center has a nice golden pyramid with a diamond core at the moment. The player starts at the top of the sphere at Sector 1,130,1.
* Fixed teleportation to places without floor.
* Made space ignite the upward booster the whole time space is pressed down.
* raised max ambient light.
* spelling fixes
* added lore to 10million trophy
* automatically eating an item now shows a message
* server and client debug output is now more useful to users
* background fog can now be bright or dark
