# Construder Binary Package for Windows

This is a binary package of the game Construder, meant to be run on Win32. It is based off ActivePerl 5.10.

Due to Construder itself being in active development this is the easiest way to keep synched with the development without having to install and compile all the dependencies on your own. It can either be used by just plain cloning the repo and playing out of that, or using the downloads provided here:

If anyone feels like contributing, by providing their own binary package or helping to maintain this in synch, feel free to ask 'mithaldu' in #sdl on the irc.perl.org IRC server.
