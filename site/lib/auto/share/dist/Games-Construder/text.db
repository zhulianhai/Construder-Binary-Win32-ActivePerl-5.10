:obj:Stones:lore
Stones are probably the most basic material found in the Construct.
They were collected by the nanobot probes from asteroids and planets
of the starsystem Anthymarsio. It proved to be a good foundation for
the Construct, but eventually it was processed into further materials.
.
:obj:Iron:lore
Probably the most useful metal found in the Construct. It's used in a wide
range of other materials, and no techical device can be built without at least
one part that has some iron in it.
.
:obj:Pattern Storage:lore
The Pattern Storage can hold the matter and energy patterns of materials. Your
inventory is designed after this. You can use this as external storage for
gathered materials that don't fit into your inventory. Even though your
inventory cannot hold an arbitrary number of complex materials, it can hold
multiple Pattern Storages.

:obj:Vaporizer A:lore
:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
A Vaporizer vaporizes materials in a certain radius around it. It's much faster
than dematerialization, as the atom bondings are dissolved in a destructive
way. You use it by building it where you want to vaporize blocks and applying
it. After many accidents, they have been enhanced to not vaporize the users.
There are multiple types of Vaporizers with different characteristics. 
.
:obj:Vaporizer A:lore
The basic and simplest type is the Vaporizer A, which destructs blocks in a
radius of 1 around itself (which are all 8 blocks).
.
:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
The type B destructs blocks in a radius of 2.
.
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
The type C vaporizes blocks in a radius of 4. However, it's slightly unreliable
due to the higher energy output, which means that sometimes it does not work.
.
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
Type D vaporizers are the most destructive ones. They can vaporize blocks in
a radius of up to 10 blocks around themselves. But they are so unreliable that
their radius varies a lot.
.
:obj:VapoModule:lore
This is a base module, used for building vaporizers.
.
:obj:Message Beacon:lore
A Message Beacon can be used to mark a small region of the Construct with a text
message that will show up in the HUD of those in its vicinity. The location of a
message beacon will be synchronized with your navigator for 30 minutes, which
can be used for navigating or teleporting to the beacon.
.
:obj:Transformer:lore
Probably the most useful piece of equipment you will regularly use. A
Transformer transforms materials. You have to build a transformation plane with
the sizes 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4. On these you can construct the patterns found
in the material handbook to form other pieces of equipment and material. Once
you have constructed a pattern, you have to hit the interaction key [e] to make
the transformer will do its job. It will complain if the pattern is not
recognized.
.
:obj:Teleporter:lore
Teleporters can instantly bring you from one place to another in the Construct.
You can direct a teleporter to the position of any synchronized message beacon
and travel there at free will by invoking the teleporter.
.
:obj:Materializer V2:lore
This is an upgrade to your integrated materializer tool. It makes
dematerialization and materialization many times faster. But be careful, it
also need as much more power and will drain your bio energy much faster! This
also means that harvesting moss will probably need as much energy as it could
provide. So be careful! The upgrade can always be disabled by throwing it away
or storing it somewhere.
.
:obj:Jumper B:lore
:obj:Jumper B+:lore
:obj:Jumper A:lore
:obj:Jumper A+:lore
A jumper can teleport you away in a certain direction before
it desintegrates itself. The main difference between the models
are their range and their accuracy.
.
:obj:Jumper B:lore
The B type has a low range, but has a high accuracy and low malfunction rate.
.
:obj:Jumper B+:lore
The B+ type has a high range, but comes with very low accuracy and high
malfunction rates.
.
:obj:Jumper A:lore
The A type has a mediocre range, but is highly accurate and reliable, similar
to the type B Jumpers.
.
:obj:Jumper A+:lore
The A+ type has a extremely high range, but is highly inaccurate and barely reliable.
