:obj:Stones:lore
Stones are probably the most basic material found in the Construct.
They were collected by the nano bot probes from asteroids and planets
of the starsystem Anthymarsio. It proved to be a good foundation for
the Construct but eventually it was processed into further materials.
.
:obj:Iron:lore
Probably the most useful metal found in the Construct. It's used in a wide
range of other materials and also any techical device can't but built without
at least on part that has some iron in it.
.
:obj:Pattern Storage:lore
The Pattern Storage can hold the matter and energy patterns of materials. Your
inventory is designed after this. You can use this as external storage for
gathered materials that don't fit into your inventory. Even though your inventory
can not hold an arbitrary number of complex materials, it can hold multiple
Pattern Storages.

:obj:Vaporizer A:lore
:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
A Vaporizer vaporizes materials in a certain radius around it. It's much faster
than dematerialization, as the atom bondings are dissolved in a destructive
way. You use it by building it in a place you want to vaporize blocks,
and apply it afterwards.
Because of too many accidents they have been enhanced to not harm the
users in any way.
There are multiple types of Vaporizers with different characteristics. 
.
:obj:Vaporizer A:lore
The basic and simplest type is the Vaporizer A, which destructs in a radius of
1 blocks around it (which are all 8 blocks).
.
:obj:Vaporizer B:lore
The type B destructs in a radius of 2.
.
:obj:Vaporizer C:lore
The type C vaporizes in a radius of 4 blocks. But it's slightly unreliable
due to the higher energy output, which means that it sometimes does not work.
.
:obj:Vaporizer D:lore
Type D vaporizers are the most destructive ones, they can vaporize blocks in
a radius up to 10 around them. But they are so unreliable, that their radius
can vary a lot.
.
:obj:VapoModule:lore
This is a base module, used for building vaporizers.
.
:obj:Message Beacon:lore
A Message beacon that can be used to mark a small region and inform you or
others with a small message. The message is shown in your HUD when you get near
to a beacon. The location of a message beacon will be synchronized with your
navigator for 30 minutes. The synchronized location can be used to navigate
back to the beacon or synchronize a teleporter destination.
.
:obj:Transformer:lore
Probably the most useful piece of equipment you will regularily use. A
Transformer transforms material. You have to build a transformation plane with
the sizes 1x1, 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4. On these you can construct the patterns found
in the material handbook to form other pieces of equipment and material. When
you constructed the pattern, you have to hit the interaction key [e] and the
transformer will do it's job or complain if the pattern is not recognized.
.
:obj:Teleporter:lore
Teleporters can bring you instantly from one place to another in the Construct.
You can direct a teleporter to the position of any synchronized message beacon
and travel there at free will by invoking the teleporter.
.
:obj:Materializer V2:lore
This is an upgrade to your integrated materializer tool. It makes
dematerialization and materialization many times faster. But be careful, it
also need as much more power and will drain your bio energy much much faster!
This also means, that harvesting moss will probably need as much energy as it
could provide. So be careful! The upgrade can always be disabled by throwing
it away or storing it somewhere.
